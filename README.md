# cifar100-cnn

This is a project for the implementation of VGG network for image recognition. Pytorch library is used to construct the deep learning module and CIFAR100 dataset is used for training the deep learning model. The testing accuracy of the model is 71%.

The CIFAR100 dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The CIFAR100 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 different classes.
